# html-js-drills

Welcome to your html-js drills!  The purpose of these drills is to get practice in using JavaScript to change the DOM (your HTML page).

To get started, please fork this repo and clone the forked version of this repo to your computer.

Pay close attention to ID and class names and don't worry about the css file!

Focus on the Javascript.  There will be research involved.

Go to the script.js file and read the comments, they will tell you what you need to do.

Good luck!
